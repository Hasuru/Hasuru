- Hi, I’m @Hasuru
- I’m interested in imperative languages, game development, data structures and algorithms in general
- I’m currently learning C++, bit manipulation and hash tables
- Since i'm still fairly new to programming, i just want to get the most info i can from those who have much more experience in coding
